# Learning GraphQL

Hi Guys :smile:

So I have trying to learn what exactly is GraphQL and how can we an api with GraphQL for a very long time. To get a grisp of the concept I thought of trying it doing myself :smiley:

This repository contains the basics of creating an API with GraphQL. I did it myself by following the steps mentioned in [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-graphql-86f849ce1bec/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-graphql-86f849ce1bec/). This article has helped me understand better:

1. What GraphQL is ?
2. Why is better to create APIs with GraphQL ?
3. Advantages of GraphQL ?
4. How to use GraphQL ?

Herein you will mainly find how to create Query, Mutations in GraphQL. Also one more advantage is that I didn't have to setup a GraphQL server manually to run queries. [GraphPack](https://github.com/glennreyes/graphpack) came as saviour. :wink:

So, like me if you too want to learn more about this latest language, dive in :smile:

Also if you like my repository and want me to come up with many such beginners courses then don't forget to star this repo :star::star::star::star::star::star::star:

Happy Coding :v::v::v:
